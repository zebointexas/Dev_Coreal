Today google engineers come from Boston and Mountain View, visited TXST. 

Here is the top give away: 

1. One of the google engineers practiced code on below two platform: 
   - https://www.hackerrank.com/
   - https://leetcode.com/  
   - "I practice on Google Doc" - this is how interview happens

2. "How do you like Computer Science? This is all I care about" - from the senior engineer. "And we do not care about university ranking"

3. For interview, 
   - Algorithm course, and Algorithm - 90% importance
   - Operating System - 6% importance 
   - Machine Learning basic concept - 4% importance

4. Interview fail with Google will freeze you for one year. "However, most of the people who join Google failed in the 1st time - so I encourage you to apply and learn from failure" - The young engineer said. 

5. We have more code regulation on C++, becasue of memory leak! 

6. Top important thing - How can you code, the technical interview. Google have 0 behavior questions. 

7. The internship for this year is closed. Yes, closed. No chance. 

8. Undergraduate mostly have internship during summer. Master student has all year round internship - but still, most of them are summer internship.
